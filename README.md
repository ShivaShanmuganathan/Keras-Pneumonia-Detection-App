# Data
https://www.kaggle.com/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia

"The dataset is organized into 3 folders (train, test, val) and contains subfolders for each image category (Pneumonia/Normal). There are 5,863 X-Ray images (JPEG) and 2 categories (Pneumonia/Normal).

Chest X-ray images (anterior-posterior) were selected from retrospective cohorts of pediatric patients of one to five years old from Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, Guangzhou. All chest X-ray imaging was performed as part of patients’ routine clinical care."

# Project Overview 
In this project I use Keras along with x-ray photos from the kaggle dataset in order to create an accurate model to classify pneumonia via chest xray images. I also create a web application and deploy it with flask and docker.
